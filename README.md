# Usage
Can be used by anyone just looking for a safe and secure password for any account set-up. It is recommended to keep note of the password as the site is not set up to store any data displayed so once the page is refreshed you will need to generate a new random password.

# Contributing
Open to any contributions though the site already executes it's necessary code with no major issues. If you do wish to add or change anything just open a new pull request before hand. Thank you.
